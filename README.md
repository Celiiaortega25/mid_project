Mid_Bootcamp_Project

1. Case Study 

The goal is to analyze the best places to be a digital nomad, taking into account the different types of marine species we can see in each of them and how many deaths and the cause of the death by city.

Four datasets were imported:

	- First one is a database where we have different variables such as the cost of been a nomad, the security of the country, the punctuation of the city of nomads that have been living 	there, internet speed, among others. 	
	(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielhain/digital-nomads)

	- Second, we have a database with all the cities and countries of the world to combine it with the first database. 
	(https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)	

	- Third, we have a database including all the marine species we can see in each country, as we only have the scientific name, we are +going to do a count of the variable per city.

	- Last one, is a database are the deaths that have occurred during the dive.

2. Questions:

	- Which countries are the best ones rated by nomads who have already lived there?

	- Best places for diving. How many different marine species can we see in each country?

	- Most dangerous countries for  scuba diving. How many accidents have been in each country?
	
	- Main causes of those deaths

4. Concluions:

	It depends on the variables to which each person attaches the most importance.
